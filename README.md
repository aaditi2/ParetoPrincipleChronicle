## Abstract  
### **General Research Problem**  
The **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** suggests that **80% of outcomes result from 20% of efforts**. In software engineering, this might mean that **20% of contributors produce 80% of the work**. However, is this true in student software projects and team-based repositories? This research investigates the distribution of contributions among team members using historical project data.

### **Primary Research Questions**  
1. Does the **Pareto Principle hold true** in software engineering team contributions?  
2. How does **contribution consistency** compare to overall contribution volume?  
3. Are certain types of contributions (e.g., code commits, issue tracking, PR reviews) more **disproportionately distributed** than others?  

This research aims to **quantify and visualize contribution disparities** using GitHub activity data, providing insights into team dynamics and equity in software engineering projects.
