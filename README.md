## ðŸ“– Abstract
The **Pareto principle (80/20 rule)** has been widely observed in professional and open-source software projects, where ~20% of contributors account for ~80% of outcomes.

This study investigates whether that principle applies to **student software engineering teams**. Using GitHub activity data from **94 teams (465 students)** across ten semesters, we analyzed contribution inequality with the **Hoover index** and **Lorenz curve**.

**Key findings:**
- Only **6 of 94 teams (6.4%)** matched the 80/20 Pareto distribution.  
- Most teams showed **more balanced contribution patterns**.  
- Academic factors (grading incentives, peer review, team scaffolding) likely mitigated contribution inequality.  
- Inferential statistics (Mannâ€“Whitney U, Spearman correlation) confirmed significant differences between Pareto and non-Pareto groups.
